# PAFF - The Multiplayer Strategy Game

Welcome to **PAFF**, the most fantastic multiplayer strategy game ever created! Well, the real name might sound serious, but let's keep it real - we call it **PAFF** because it's just that awesome.

## Purpose

**PAFF** is designed to bring you and your friends together for an epic strategy showdown. Battle it out in a world where strategy meets fun, and may the best tactician win!
